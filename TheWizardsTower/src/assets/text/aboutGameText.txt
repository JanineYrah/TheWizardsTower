The game takes place inside of a tower, owned by a powerful wizard who lives in there. You, Hadria Sprite (Player), came from the fallen noble family of the kingdom of Hircan, whose glory had ended in the last decade. You have managed to sneak inside the wizard's tower, with the intent of stealing a powerful grimoire that can lend you magic that can manipulate space and time. A book, if landed onto the wrong hands, will cause devastation across the entire continent of Arcania. You want this grimoire to be able to turn back time and recover the lost oath that started your familyâ€™s inheritance of the kingdom. You fought and went through adventures to finally get in this tower, and get your hands on the book that you wished to use. Now you have to explore and traverse through the floors. But beware, for the path is perilous.
